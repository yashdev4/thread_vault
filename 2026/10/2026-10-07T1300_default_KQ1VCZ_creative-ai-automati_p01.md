Here's something genuinely creative: **Multi-modal Context Agents That Learn Domain Vocabularies**.

Most automation today is rule-based or narrowly scoped. Imagine AI agents that:

1. **Ingest your actual workflows** — They parse your emails, Slack messages, documents, and past decisions to build a "dictionary" of how your specific organization thinks and operates.

2. **Generate domain-specific micro-automations** — Instead of one big workflow, they create tiny, chainable agents that handle specific recurring patterns. For example:
   - An agent that reads incoming customer requests in your company's language and categorizes them
   - Another that drafts responses matching your tone
   - A third that surfaces edge cases that need human judgment

3. **Learn and evolve** — They observe what humans approve/reject and continuously refine their understanding of acceptable outputs, essentially building a living playbook of your work.

**Real-world example from your context**: You're already working on a candidate screening agent. A next-level version would:
- Learn the specific competencies and red flags your hiring team cares about from past calls
- Adapt its questioning style based on role seniority 
- Generate a personalized summary format that matches how your recruiters actually think
- Improve its qualification rubric from every call reviewed

**Why it's powerful**: It moves automation from "do this task exactly this way" to "understand this domain deeply, then handle variations intelligently."

The infrastructure is already here (Claude's API, MCP servers, your internal data). The creative leap is treating your organization's existing decisions and communication as training data for increasingly autonomous but *contextually wise* agents.

## Multi-modal Context Agents: Deep Dive

These agents become powerful when they can **simultaneously process different types of organizational data** and act as a system:

### **The Architecture**

**Input Layer (Multi-modal Ingestion):**
- **Structured data** → CRM records, tickets, implementation tasks (your Odoo DB)
- **Unstructured data** → Emails, Slack conversations, call transcripts
- **Visual/formatted data** → PDFs, documents, decision matrices
- **Historical decisions** → Approvals, rejections, corrections your team made

**Context Building Layer:**
```
Email tone + vocabulary
    ↓
Decision patterns
    ↓
Role-specific jargon
    ↓
Edge cases & exceptions
    ↓
Organizational "culture codebook"
```

**Agent Layer (Autonomous Execution):**
- Agent A: Classifies/triage incoming work
- Agent B: Drafts responses/plans
- Agent C: Flags ambiguities for humans
- Agent D: Learns from human feedback → updates playbook

---

### **Concrete Implementation at EOXS/Askcruz**

For your business, this could look like:

**1. Intake Agent Network** (your Purchase Order Intake project)
- Ingests: Past PO forms, accepted vs. rejected submissions, email exchanges
- Learns: What makes a "good" PO intake in your process
- Acts: Auto-classifies new POs → drafts clarifications → surfaces blockers
- Feedback loop: When your team corrects it, the agent refines its rubric

**2. Implementation Task Router** (Odoo integration)
- Ingests: Call transcripts, ticket descriptions, past task assignments
- Learns: Which client types need which team, common pitfalls per industry
- Acts: Suggests task breakdown, recommends assignees, flags risky assumptions
- Evolves: Every completed task → training data for next similar project

**3. Email/Comms Context Agent** (your Gmail MCP)
- Ingests: Your actual sent emails, responses clients approve/complain about
- Learns: Your team's decision-making voice, what clients actually understand vs. ignore
- Acts: Drafts emails, Slack summaries, call agendas that fit your culture
- Self-corrects: Observes engagement metrics → learns what resonates

---

### **Why "Multi-modal" Matters**

A single-mode agent (text-only, or email-only) misses the full picture. But when agents see:
- **What was said** (emails/transcripts)
- **How decisions were made** (Odoo tasks, approvals)
- **What happened after** (client outcomes, feedback)

...they build **causal understanding**. They stop just matching patterns and start reasoning like your team does.

---

### **Real Automation Win**

Instead of:
> *"Build a bot that fills in the PO form fields"*

You get:
> *"Deploy a system that understands why certain POs fail, what your team actually cares about, and proactively catches problems before humans waste time"*

**Buildable right now** with:
- Claude API (for reasoning)
- Your MCP connectors (Slack, Gmail, Odoo DB)
- Your conversation history as ground truth

Would you want to architect this for a specific workflow at Askcruz?

## Claude

Perfect timing—this directly relates to your threads-mcp-qa-automation area. Here's a **fully automated MCP testing framework** that eliminates manual Claude prompting:

## **Automated MCP QA Architecture**

### **1. Test Harness (Core Engine)**

Instead of manually prompting in Claude, build a **programmatic test runner**:

```python
# mcp_qa_harness.py
import json
import asyncio
from anthropic import Anthropic

class MCPTestRunner:
    def __init__(self, mcp_servers):
        self.client = Anthropic()
        self.mcp_servers = mcp_servers
        self.results = []
    
    async def run_test(self, test_case):
        """Execute single test case against Claude API + MCP server"""
        response = self.client.messages.create(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
            max_tokens=1000,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": test_case["prompt"]}],
            tools=[...],  # Your MCP tool definitions
            mcp_servers=self.mcp_servers  # Include MCP servers
        )
        
        # Validate response against expected behavior
        validation = self.validate_response(
            response, 
            test_case["expected"]
        )
        
        self.results.append({
            "test_id": test_case["id"],
            "status": "pass" if validation["is_valid"] else "fail",
            "details": validation
        })
    
    def validate_response(self, response, expected):
        """Check if Claude's response + MCP interaction meets requirements"""
        tool_calls = [b for b in response.content if b.type == "tool_use"]
        
        return {
            "is_valid": len(tool_calls) == len(expected["tool_calls"]),
            "tool_match": self.match_tool_calls(tool_calls, expected),
            "response_quality": self.check_reasoning(response)
        }
```

---

### **2. Test Case Definition (YAML/JSON)**

Define test scenarios without writing code each time:

```yaml
test_suite:
  - id: "threads_query_001"
    name: "Query recent threads with filters"
    prompt: "Find all threads from Yash in September"
    mcp_server: "threads-ov"
    expected:
      tool_calls:
        - name: "search_wiki"
          params:
            query: "contains Yash"
            timeframe: "september"
      response_contains:
        - "thread"
        - "september"
    timeout_seconds: 5
    
  - id: "odoo_query_002"
    name: "Fetch implementation tasks for specific client"
    prompt: "Show me all open tasks for Acme Corp"
    mcp_server: "read-only"
    expected:
      tool_calls:
        - name: "query"
          params:
            table: "implementation_tasks"
      response_contains:
        - "acme"
        - "open"
    timeout_seconds: 3
```

---

### **3. Validation Framework**

Multi-level response checking:

```python
class ResponseValidator:
    def validate_tool_invocation(self, expected_tool, actual_tool):
        """Did Claude call the right tool?"""
        return (
            expected_tool["name"] == actual_tool.name and
            self.params_match(expected_tool["params"], actual_tool.input)
        )
    
    def validate_content_accuracy(self, response_text, expected_keywords):
        """Does response contain required info?"""
        return all(kw.lower() in response_text.lower() for kw in expected_keywords)
    
    def validate_error_handling(self, response, error_scenario):
        """Did Claude handle edge cases correctly?"""
        # Test malformed queries, timeouts, missing data
        return "error" in response.lower() or "unclear" in response.lower()
    
    def validate_performance(self, response_time, timeout):
        """Did the MCP call complete in time?"""
        return response_time < timeout
```

---

### **4. CI/CD Integration**

Automated testing on every commit:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/mcp-qa.yml
name: MCP Server QA

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Run MCP Test Suite
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          python -m pytest mcp_qa_harness.py --test-config=tests/mcp_tests.yaml
      
      - name: Generate Report
        run: python generate_qa_report.py
      
      - name: Fail if coverage < 95%
        run: python check_coverage.py --threshold=0.95
      
      - name: Upload Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: qa-report
          path: reports/
```

---

### **5. Real Test Scenarios (For Threads MCP)**

```yaml
test_suite:
  scenario_1:
    name: "Basic search across all conversation archives"
    tests:
      - prompt: "Show me all conversations from August"
        expected_tools: ["vault_find"]
        expected_output_contains: ["august", "conversation"]
        should_not_contain: ["error", "cannot"]
  
  scenario_2:
    name: "Complex filtering with multiple criteria"
    tests:
      - prompt: "Find threads about Odoo implementation by Yash in Q3"
        expected_tools: ["vault_find", "vault_stats"]
        response_validations:
          - has_conversations: true
          - author_matches: "yash"
          - date_range: ["2026-07-01", "2026-09-30"]
  
  scenario_3:
    name: "Error handling - malformed queries"
    tests:
      - prompt: "Find conversations from year 5000"
        should_fail_gracefully: true
        expected_response_contains: ["unclear", "cannot", "try"]
  
  scenario_4:
    name: "Performance benchmarks"
    tests:
      - prompt: "List all threads"
        max_response_time_ms: 5000
        expected_tools: ["vault_list"]
```

---

### **6. Automated Reporting**

```python
class QAReporter:
    def generate_report(self, results):
        report = {
            "summary": {
                "total_tests": len(results),
                "passed": sum(1 for r in results if r["status"] == "pass"),
                "failed": sum(1 for r in results if r["status"] == "fail"),
                "pass_rate": f"{(passed/total)*100:.1f}%"
            },
            "by_mcp_server": self.group_by_server(results),
            "performance": self.analyze_speed(results),
            "failed_tests": [r for r in results if r["status"] == "fail"],
            "regression_check": self.compare_to_baseline(results)
        }
        return report
```

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Week 1:** Build test harness + run against Threads MCP
2. **Week 2:** Define comprehensive test suite for each MCP server
3. **Week 3:** Add CI/CD pipeline + baseline metrics
4. **Week 4:** Automate regression testing + set up alerts

---

### **Benefits for Your Team**

✅ **Yash/Shubham/Stefan** can define new test cases without coding  
✅ **Automated runs** on every MCP update (no manual retesting)  
✅ **Regression detection** (catch breaks before production)  
✅ **Performance tracking** (know if MCP calls are slowing down)  
✅ **Audit trail** (every test result logged for compliance)
